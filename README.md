# BSTSet
Binary Search Tree implementation

Lab Description:


In this lab you will implement the Set abstract data type using binary search trees.
We will consider sets of integers where each integer will be stored in a tree node. 
Therefore,the number of nodes in the binary search tree must be equal to the size of the set.
You  will  have  to  write  a Java class BSTSet for this  purpose.
To  implement the tree nodes you must use the Java class TNode provided in this lab. 
Additionally, you may need to implement Java classes MyStack and/or MyQueue to perform non-recursive tree traversals  of  a BSTSet.
You  are not  permittedto  use  any  predefined Java methods or classes from Java API, other than for input and output, unless specified otherwise. You must also write a test class TestBSTSet.
Please compute the asymptotic run timeand  space  complexity  of  all  methods  and  be  ready  to  present  them  to  the  TA  with explanations at your demo.
